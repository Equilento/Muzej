        "description": "During the Renaissance, it was common practice to re-work ancient Roman sculpture. Narcissus was long thought to be an example of this, but instead it was possibly made by a sculptor and restorer called Valerio Cioli. A Greek myth tells how Narcissus fell in love with his reflection in a pool. This made him a suitable subject for garden sculpture.",

One of the most popular saints was St Peter, the first Pope. He was often shown holding the keys to Heaven and wearing his papal tiara. This figure was originally brightly painted. It would probably have been set in a church, on a console or ledge on one of the nave columns, with candles burning before it.",
